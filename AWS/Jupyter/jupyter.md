###Run Project Jupyter Notebooks On Amazon EC2

This is extracted from: https://chrisalbon.com/aws/basics/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/


This is tutorial on running Project Jupyter Notebook on an Amazon EC2 instance. It is based on a tutorial by Piyush Agarwal which did not work for me immediately, but I tweaked a few things and got it working.

Note: This is not a beginner’s tutorial. I don’t explain some of the steps fully and don’t explain some concepts. There are other tutorials out there for that.

Create an AWS account
An EC2 instance requires an AWS account. You can make an account here.

Navigate to EC2
Log into AWS and go to the EC2 main page. Then you will see a ‘Launch Instance’ button.

Launch a new instance
